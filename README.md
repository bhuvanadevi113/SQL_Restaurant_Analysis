# SQL_Restaurant_Analysis

## ASSIGNMENT
The Taste of the World Caf√© debuted a new menu at the start of the year I have been asked to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customers seem to like best. 

## OBJECTIVES
1. Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu.
2. Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been collected.
3. Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu.

## Explore the items table
The first objective is to better understand the items table by finding the number of rows in the table, the least and most expensive items, and the item prices within each category.

1.View the menu_items table and write a query to find the number of items on the menu\
2.What are the least and most expensive items on the menu?\
3.How many Italian dishes are on the menu? What are the least and most expensive Italian dishes on the menu?\
4.How many dishes are in each category? What is the average dish price within each category?

## Explore the orders table
The second objective is to better understand the orders table by finding the date range, the number of items within each order, and the orders with the highest number of items.

1.View the order_details table. What is the date range of the table?\
2.How many orders were made within this date range? How many items were ordered within this date range?\
3.Which orders had the most number of items?\
4.How many orders had more than 12 items?

## Analyze customer behavior
 Final objective is to combine the items and orders tables, find the least and most ordered categories, and dive into the details of the highest spend orders.
 
1.Combine the menu_items and order_details tables into a single table\
2.What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?\
3.What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?\
4.View the details of the highest spend order. Which specific items were purchased?\
5.View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders

All the above analysis is done by using MySql and attached the SQL file
